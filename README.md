# Stochastic Differential Equation Modelling using Gaussian Processes

This repository contains code to perform variational inference over the path of a latent stochastic differential equation (SDE) and learning of its nonlinear drift function, modelled using a Gaussian Process.

The code is still under active development and is expected to change substantially in the future. We include implementations for Gaussian observation models and linear mappings from latents to observations here, and are planning to release a revised code distribution in the future.

## Getting started
./demos contains examples on how to use the code.
